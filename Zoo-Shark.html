        <p> The Megalodon Shark is the largest shark to ever roam the seas up until about 3.6 million years ago. Still, it is very common to still find Megalodon teeth around the world due to the rate at which sharks cycle through their teeth. </p>
        <p> Some Of it's characteristics are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Their length estimates reach 15 to 18 metres </li>
            <li> Their teeth can reach about 18 cm long </li>
            <li> Their jaw would span 2.7 to 3.4 metres wide </li>
